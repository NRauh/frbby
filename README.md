# Frbby

Find a furbaby and learn Angular.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install`.

Once that's done you can use `npm start` to run the dev server (http://localhost:4200).
The app will reload on saves.

Use `npm run ng -- ${command}` to use angular-cli commands without having to install it globally.
[Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md). 

There are some tests if you want to see how those can look out of the box.
Run them with `npm test`.

## Dojo Ideas

The goal of the dojo is to get a feel for Angular.
You should try to do this by taking this app, and attempting to add something more to it.

You can do whatever you want, but here's some ideas to help you get going.

* Make swiping on a card like or dislike a pet (hint: look up HammerJS and Angular)
* Change the navbar button colors based on route (hint: look up Angular [class])
* Add a transition between the routes (either with css or Angular animations)
* Make matches persist if the app closes
* Add dogs to the potential matches
* Send an alert on a match
* Let the user send a message
    - Get a meow back
    - Get a chatbot to reply
